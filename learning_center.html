          NASA’s newest space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, has returned its first set of images and spectra of five different targets – from nebulae to exoplanets to galaxy clusters – revealing the universe in ways never before seen. These targets, selected by a team of experts, represent just the start of the telescope's science operations and the beginning of our ability to see the universe in a whole new way.

Read on to learn more about what the space-based observatory’s images can tell us about the cosmos, how they were captured, and how to engage learners in the science and engineering behind the mission.

          If you happen to have clear skies on Wednesday night, you'll be able to catch a planet disappearing behind the moon.

The event occurs at a special time for Mars. On Wednesday night, Mars will be directly opposite the sun's position in the sky, rising as the sun sets and setting as the sun rises. This is called an opposition and is when Mars is at its brightest in the night sky.

"Having the moon hide a bright planet is rare," said Alan Dyer, an amateur astronomer and accomplished astrophotographer who will watch the event from his home near Strathmore, Alta.

"Having it do so on the very night a planet is at its brightest, as Mars now is, is very unusual. And with the objects so well-placed high in our sky. Fabulous!"

When a planet or a star disappears behind another object, it's called an occultation. The next time this happens between the moon and Mars will be in January 2025, although it will be two days before opposition.

          The Hubble Space Telescope has caught a vivid image of an open star cluster in one of the Milky Way’s satellite galaxies. The telescope captured an enthralling cluster of stars known as NGC 1858 in an area rich in star-forming zones. NASA took to Instagram to reveal this gleaming sea of stars, which is tinged with blue, white, and intense orange light radiating from distant celestial entities.

The image depicts a vivid blue cloud against a backdrop of what appears to be an ocean of glistening stars. The size of the stars varies, demonstrating that while some are close to the telescope, others are many light years distant.
